## Welcome to Pelham's ECE 4760 final project page!

# Project Introduction

ECE 4760 is a microcontrollers class, so the standard platform we use for all our projects is the Raspberry Pi Pico. We code in C and use different hardware periperals to make our microcontroller perform different functions, such as emulating birdsong and implementing PID control. For my final project, I drew on a couple functions we had worked on earlier in the year, specifically analog-to-digital conversion, direct digital synthesis, and PWM signal generation.

My project was turning my Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller into a synthesizer, controlled by a MIDI keyboard output. I set my sights high, as this is a highly expandable project idea, and planned to be able to generate sound via different waveforms, suhc as square waves and sine waves. If I had time, I would have added some analog effects to the synthesizer output, normalizing for the different voltages required by 1/4 inch and 3 mm headphone jacks.
